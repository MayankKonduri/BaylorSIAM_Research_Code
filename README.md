# Cerebral Tumor Quantitative Simulation Project Summary (April 2023 - October 2024)

## Abstract
In this work, we address the challenge of inverse parameter identification in semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), with a specific focus on tumor growth modeling. Our objective is to accurately estimate model parameters from noisy observational data. Traditionally, these parameter identification problems have been tackled using variational techniques, which can be limited in their robustness to noise. We explore an innovative approach by employing dense neural networks (DNNs) to map observations directly to model parameters, effectively constructing a data-driven reconstruction map.
